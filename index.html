<h1>goxtool.py</h1>
goxtool is a trading client for the MtGox Bitcoin currency exchange. It
allows you to watch live market data, to send or cancel orders or to
run a fully automated trading bot. It is designed to work in the linux
console (sorry, no Windows yet), its written in Python and is using the
(n)curses library to draw its user interface (it does <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> have a GTK or Qt interface), all
it needs to run is a terminal (either locally or remote through ssh or
putty).<br>
<br>
It looks like this:<br>
(TODO: insert screenshot of terminal here)<br>
<br>
<h2>How to install</h2>
Go to an empty folder or to the folder you usually use to clone
repositories and clone the master branch:<br>
<br>
<pre>git clone git://github.com/prof7bit/goxtool.git</pre>
<br>
This will create a folder named <span style="font-family: monospace;">goxtool-master</span>
containing all the needed files. Thats all, now it is installed and
ready to use. You can now already watch live market data (without any
trading functions being enabled), you can later add a MtGox API-key to
it to have full access to your account but for now just proceed to the
next step, start it without an account, just to make sure everything
works.<br>
<br>
<h2>How to start it
</h2>
change into to the <span style="font-family: monospace;">goxtool-master</span>
folder that was created in the previous step and start
goxtool.py:<br>
<br>
<pre>cd goxtool-master<br>./goxtool.py</pre>
<br>
