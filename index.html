<h1>goxtool.py</h1>
goxtool is a trading client for the MtGox Bitcoin currency exchange. It
allows you to watch live market data, to send or cancel orders or to
run a fully automated trading bot. It is designed to work in the Linux
console (sorry, no Windows yet), its written in Python and is using the
(n)curses library to draw its user interface (it does <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> have a GTK or Qt interface), all
it needs to run is a terminal (either locally or remote through ssh or
putty).<br />
<br />
It looks like this:<br />
(TODO: insert screenshot of terminal here)<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
</span>
<h2>How to install
</h2>
Open a terminal in an empty folder or in the folder you usually use to
clone
repositories and clone the master branch:<br />
<br />
<pre>git clone git://github.com/prof7bit/goxtool.git</pre>
<br />
This will create a folder named <span style="font-family: monospace;">goxtool-master</span>
containing all the needed files. Thats all, now it is installed and
ready to use. You can now already watch live market data (without any
trading functions being enabled), you can later add a MtGox API-key to
it to have full access to your account but for now just proceed to the
next step, start it without an account, just to make sure everything
works.<br />
<br />
<h2>How to start it
</h2>
change into to the <span style="font-family: monospace;">goxtool-master</span>
folder that was created in the previous step and start
goxtool.py:<br />
<br />
<pre>cd goxtool-master<br />./goxtool.py</pre>
<br />
Keyboad commands (only the ones useful in view-only mode):<br />
<ul>
  <li><span class="keycmd">q</span>&nbsp;: quit</li>
  <li><span class="keycmd">l</span>&nbsp;: (lower case "L") reload the
strategy module (see advanced
usage)</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to connect it to your MtGox account</h2>
Do the following:<br />
<pre>./goxtool.py --add-secret<br /></pre>
This will now ask you for key, secret and
password. Key and secret
belong to a shared secret that is created by MtGox to authenticate your
trading software against their API. You can request as many keys from
MtGox as you need, every application you connect to your MtGox account
should have its own key, you can also at any time delete the keys again
that you no longer need.<br />
<br />
Now you need a Key/Secret pair for goxtool. Open your web browser, log
in to your MtGox account, click on "Security Center", click on
"Advanced API Key Creation", choose a name for your key (every key will
have a name so you can later easily tell them apart), make sure you
check at least the boxes "Get Info" and "Trade" (this is what the
application will be allowed to do with this key) and then finally click
on "Create Key".<br />
<br />
Now MtGox will create 2 strings of cryptic numbers and letters, the
"API-Key" and the "Secret". Now cpoy&amp;paste the API-Key into the
terminal where it asked you for "Key", press enter, now it will ask you
for "Secret", copy&amp;paste the Secret into the tetminal, press enter
and now it will ask you for a passphrase. It is important to understand
what is going on here. The Key/Secret from above must under no
circumstances ever come into the wrong hands, therefore goxtool won't
just store them in the .ini file, goxtool will encrypt it and thats
what the passphrase is needed for. Choose a secure passphrase (it will
ask you twice to make sure there is no typo), you will also not see
anything in the console (not even "*") while typing, this is not a bug,
this is intentional. Choose a strong passphrase, type it into the
terminal, press enter, repeat the passphrase, press enter again and now
it will tell you that it has been encrypted and saved to the .ini file
and exit.<br />
<br />
Now start goxtool again:<br />
<br />
<pre>./goxtool.py<br />enter passphrase for secret: <br /></pre>
From now on every time you start goxtool it will ask you for the
passphrase in order to be able to decrypt and use the secret. Enter
your pasphrase, press enter. Now goxtool will start and you will notice
that now it is showing your account balance at the top of the window.
Now all trading functions are enabled.<br />
<br />
Keyboad commands for trading are:<br />
<ul>
  <li><span class="keycmd">F4</span>&nbsp;: New buy order</li>
  <li><span class="keycmd">F5</span>&nbsp;: New sell order</li>
  <li><span class="keycmd">F6</span>&nbsp;: View orders / cancel
order(s)</li>
</ul>
<br />
